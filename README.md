# A New Steganography Technique Based on Dotted Arabic Letters Features
In this work, we propose to use for the first time in the literature, the
position of points in dotted Arabic letters combining with other
Arabic text features to create a new steganography technique.
Based on this idea, we introduce new secret bit patterns that
could allow us to hide three bits of secret information into
a cover object instead of one bit, and hence greatly enhance
the capacity performance. Experiments show the effectiveness
of our proposed technique by outperforming other existing
steganography methods.

# Requirements
Matlab 2019 or later

# Example of run

The main file is : HybridArSA.mlapp, so just run it after that you will get the following interface:
